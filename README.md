## PCB adapter for Raspberry Pi to Hub75 RGB Matrixes
==================================================

Since hand-wiring can be a little tedious, here are some PCBs that help
with the wiring when using the `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` code.

   * [DMD-RaspberryPi](./DMD-RaspberryPi) active adapter board <br>
     Supports three parallel chains with active buffering
     and 3.3V -> 5V level shifting for best reliability. Requires SMD soldering.<br>
     EAGLE 7.x files, added WAGO 2060 cable clamp for powering the RPI.
